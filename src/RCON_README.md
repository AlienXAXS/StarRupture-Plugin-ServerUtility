# ServerUtility — RCON & Steam Query Protocol

## Overview

The **ServerUtility** plugin adds remote administration capabilities to a Star Rupture dedicated server via two standard protocols:

| Protocol | Transport | Default Port | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Source RCON** | TCP | `-RconPort=` | Authenticated remote command execution |
| **Steam A2S Query** | UDP | Same port | Server browser / status queries |

Both servers bind to the same port number (TCP and UDP respectively).

---

## Command-Line Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `-RconPort=<port>` | Yes | TCP/UDP port for RCON and A2S query (1–65535) |
| `-RconPassword=<password>` | Yes | Password for RCON authentication |
| `-SessionName=<name>` | No | Server name shown in A2S info responses (default: `StarRupture Server`) |

Both `-RconPort=` and `-RconPassword=` must be set for the RCON subsystem to start. If either is missing, the plugin logs an informational message and skips initialisation.

**Example launch:**
```
StarRupture-Server.exe -SessionName="My Server" -RconPort=27015 -RconPassword=mysecretpass
```

---

## Source RCON Protocol

The RCON server implements the [Source RCON protocol](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_RCON_Protocol) (Valve specification). Any standard RCON client (e.g. `mcrcon`, `rcon-cli`, game server panels) should work out of the box.

### Packet Format
| Field | Size | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Size** | 4 bytes | Number of bytes in the rest of the packet (`ID` + `Type` + `Body` + 2 null bytes). Maximum 4096. |
| **ID** | 4 bytes | Client-chosen request ID, echoed back in the response. Set to `-1` on auth failure. |
| **Type** | 4 bytes | Packet type (see below) |
| **Body** | Variable | Null-terminated ASCII string (command text or response text) |
| **Pad** | 1 byte | Always `0x00` |

### Packet Types

| Value | Direction | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0` | Server → Client | `SERVERDATA_RESPONSE_VALUE` | Response to a command |
| `2` | Server → Client | `SERVERDATA_AUTH_RESPONSE` | Authentication result |
| `2` | Client → Server | `SERVERDATA_EXECCOMMAND` | Execute a command |
| `3` | Client → Server | `SERVERDATA_AUTH` | Authenticate with password |

> **Note:** `SERVERDATA_EXECCOMMAND` and `SERVERDATA_AUTH_RESPONSE` share type value `2`. They are distinguished by direction (client→server vs server→client).

### Authentication Flow

1. Client connects via TCP.
2. Client sends a `SERVERDATA_AUTH` (type `3`) packet with the password in the body.
3. On success:
   - Server sends an empty `SERVERDATA_RESPONSE_VALUE` (type `0`) with the client's request ID.
- Server sends a `SERVERDATA_AUTH_RESPONSE` (type `2`) with the client's request ID.
4. On failure:
   - Server sends a `SERVERDATA_AUTH_RESPONSE` (type `2`) with ID set to `-1`.
   - Server closes the connection.

The empty `RESPONSE_VALUE` before the `AUTH_RESPONSE` follows the Source RCON specification — many clients require it and will hang without it.

### Command Execution Flow

1. Client sends a `SERVERDATA_EXECCOMMAND` (type `2`) packet with the command string in the body.
2. Server dispatches the command handler to the **game thread** (UGameEngine::Tick) and blocks the network thread until the result is ready (30-second timeout).
3. Server sends a `SERVERDATA_RESPONSE_VALUE` (type `0`) packet with the command output.

### Connection Behaviour

| Setting | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Receive timeout | 5 minutes | Accommodates idle admin sessions |
| TCP keepalive | Enabled | Probes start after 60s idle, every 10s, 3 retries |
| Max packet size | 4096 bytes | Per Source RCON specification |
| Concurrency | 1 thread per client | Suitable for low-concurrency admin use |

---

## Game-Thread Dispatch

All RCON commands run on the **game thread** by default. This is critical because many commands interact with Unreal Engine subsystems that assert `IsInGameThread()`.

The flow is:

| Step | Thread | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | RCON client thread | `CommandHandler::Execute()` is called with the command string |
| 2 | RCON client thread | A task (lambda + future) is posted to the dispatch queue |
| 3 | RCON client thread | Blocks waiting for the future to complete (30-second timeout) |
| 4 | Game thread | `Rcon::OnTick()` fires on the next engine tick |
| 5 | Game thread | `GameThreadDispatch::Drain()` picks up the queued task |
| 6 | Game thread | The command handler runs and sets the result on the future |
| 7 | RCON client thread | The future completes; the result string is sent back to the client |

Commands that don't touch engine state can opt out by registering with `gameThread = false`.

## Available Commands

Sending an empty command or an unrecognised command returns the help text.

### `players` / `list` / `who`

List all connected players with their ping.

```
> players
Players (2 connected):
  Player Name      Time On Server  IP Address      Latency
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  [1] Alice        2h 15m 30s      N/A             42 ms
  [2] Bob          0m 45s          N/A             18 ms
```

### `save` / `savegame` / `forcesave`

Force an immediate world save by calling `UCrSaveSubsystem::SaveNextSaveGame`. The save runs synchronously on the game thread; the RCON response is returned after it completes.

```
> save
World saved successfully.
```

Possible errors:
- `Error: save function not found (pattern not matched).` — The byte-pattern scan for `SaveNextSaveGame` failed (game update may have changed the binary).
- `Error: save subsystem not available (world may not be loaded yet).` — No `UCrSaveSubsystem` instance found (too early in startup).
- `Error: exception occurred during save.` — SEH exception caught during the save call.
- `Error: command timed out waiting for game thread.` — The game thread didn't process the request within 30 seconds.

### `stop` / `quit` / `exit` / `shutdown`

Initiate a graceful server shutdown by calling `FWindowsPlatformMisc::RequestExit(false)`. This sets `GIsRequestingExit = true`, which the engine picks up on the next tick — identical to pressing Ctrl+C in the server console. The engine's normal save-and-shutdown path runs automatically.

```
> stop
Server is shutting down gracefully...
```

The response is sent back before the shutdown signal fires (300ms delay) so the client receives confirmation.

## Steam A2S Query Protocol

The UDP server implements the [Steam Server Query](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_queries) protocol for server browser integration.

### Supported Query Types

| Query | Request Header | Response Header | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A2S_INFO** | `0x54` (`T`) | `0x49` (`I`) | Server name, map, player count, game info |
| **A2S_PLAYER** | `0x55` (`U`) | `0x44` (`D`) | Per-player name, score, and duration |
| **A2S_RULES** | `0x56` (`V`) | `0x45` (`E`) | Server rules / key-value pairs |

### A2S_INFO Response Fields

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Protocol | `17` |
| Server Name | From `-SessionName=` or `"StarRupture Server"` |
| Map | Current world name (e.g. `ChimeraMain`) |
| Folder | `StarRupture` |
| Game | `Star Rupture` |
| App ID | `0` |
| Players | Current connected count |
| Max Players | Server max (currently hardcoded) |
| Bots | `0` |
| Server Type | `d` (dedicated) |
| OS | `w` (Windows) |
| Visibility | `0` (public) |
| VAC | `0` (unsecured) |

### A2S_PLAYER Challenge-Response

The player query uses a challenge-response to prevent spoofed requests:

1. Client sends `A2S_PLAYER` with challenge `0xFFFFFFFF`.
2. Server responds with `S2C_CHALLENGE` (`0x41`) containing a unique 32-bit challenge number.
3. Client re-sends `A2S_PLAYER` with the received challenge.
4. Server validates and responds with the player list.

### A2S_RULES Response

Returns server key-value pairs:

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `world` | Current world/map name |
| `players` | Current player count |
| `maxplayers` | Maximum player count |

## Security — Remote Vulnerability Patch

A vulnerability in the game's built-in HTTP server allows unauthenticated remote callers to invoke arbitrary Unreal Engine remote object calls via the `/remote/object/call` endpoint. See the [vulnerability announcement](https://wiki.starrupture-utilities.com/en/dedicated-server/Vulnerability-Announcement) for full details.

ServerUtility includes a patch that intercepts this endpoint and blocks any call whose `objectPath` does not target the legitimate `DedicatedServerSettingsComp` object. Blocked requests receive an HTTP `403 Forbidden` response and are logged as warnings.

### Configuration

The patch is controlled by `RemoteVulnerabilityPatch` in the `[Security]` section of `ServerUtility.ini`:

```ini
[Security]
RemoteVulnerabilityPatch=true
```

| Value | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `true` *(default)* | Unauthorized `/remote/object/call` requests are blocked and logged |
| `false` | No interception — the game's HTTP server handles all requests as normal |

> **It is strongly recommended to leave this enabled.** Only disable it if you have a specific reason and your server is not exposed to untrusted networks.

### What gets logged

When a request is blocked, two `WARN` lines are written to `modloader.log`:

```
[WARN] [RemoteVulnerabilityPatcher] Blocked unauthorized /remote/object/call
[WARN] [RemoteVulnerabilityPatcher]   objectPath:   '/Game/...'
[WARN] [RemoteVulnerabilityPatcher]   functionName: '...'
```

Legitimate requests (those targeting the allowed object path) pass through silently.

## Troubleshooting

### RCON won't start
- Check that both `-RconPort=` and `-RconPassword=` are on the command line.
- Check the mod loader log for `[Rcon]` messages — they report exactly which parameter is missing.
- Ensure the port isn't already in use by another process.

### Client can't authenticate
- Verify the password matches exactly (case-sensitive).
- Some clients send the password with trailing whitespace — check client settings.

### Commands time out
- The game thread must be running for commands to execute. If the server is frozen or in a loading screen, commands will time out after 30 seconds.
- Check the mod loader log for `[EngineTick]` messages confirming the tick hook is installed.

### Pattern scan failures
- Game updates may change function byte patterns. Check the log for `pattern not found` errors.
- Update the patterns in `scan_patterns.h` (mod loader) or the command source files (plugin) to match the new binary.

### Remote Vulnerability Patch not activating
- Check the log at startup for `[RemoteVulnerabilityPatcher] Hook installed successfully` — if absent, the pattern scan failed (game update may have changed the binary).
- If `FHttpServerResponse::Error not located` appears, the patch is still active but blocked requests will drop the connection rather than receiving a 403 response. The exploit is still blocked.

### Firewall / port forwarding
- The RCON port needs both **TCP** (RCON) and **UDP** (A2S query) forwarded.
- Windows Firewall may block the server binary — add an inbound rule for the port.

## Compatible RCON Clients

Any client implementing the Source RCON protocol should work, including:

- [mcrcon](https://github.com/Tiiffi/mcrcon) (CLI)
- [rcon-cli](https://github.com/gorcon/rcon-cli) (CLI)
- [RustAdmin](https://www.rustadmin.com/) (GUI, originally for Rust servers)
- [RCON Web Admin](https://github.com/rcon-web-admin/rcon-web-admin) (Web-based)
- Custom scripts using any Source RCON library (Python, Node.js, C#, etc.)
